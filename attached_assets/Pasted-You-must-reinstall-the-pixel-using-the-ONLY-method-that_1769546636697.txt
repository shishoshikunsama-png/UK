You must reinstall the pixel using the ONLY method that works correctly for PageView + Lead.
Follow these steps EXACTLY and do NOT change anything else.
Do not invent new logic. Do not move code. Do not restructure pages.
Just implement the pixel correctly.”

⸻

1️⃣ PAGEVIEW — MUST GO IN <head> ON EVERY PAGE

Open the file that loads the <head> (usually index.html and success.html).

Insert this the SAME way every time, right before </head>:

<!-- Meta Pixel Code -->
<script>
!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
{if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
fbq('init', 'PIXEL_ID_HERE');
fbq('track', 'PageView');
</script>

<noscript>
  <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none"
  src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=PIXEL_ID_HERE&ev=PageView&noscript=1"/>
</noscript>
<!-- End Meta Pixel Code -->

RULES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED:
 • This MUST be inside <head> — not body
 • This MUST NOT appear twice on the same page
 • The <noscript> MUST go inside <body> if Vite throws an error
 • The ID MUST match exactly
 • No edits, no rearranging

If PageView shows “Invalid,” it means:
✔ You placed it in the wrong area OR
✔ Pixel appears twice OR
✔ You accidentally added Lead inside the head

Fix it.

⸻

2️⃣ LEAD — MUST FIRE ON THE SUCCESS PAGE ONLY

Lead is NOT fired when clicking the “Join Telegram” button.

Lead MUST fire only when the user reaches the countdown page (success.html or join.html).

Inside that page, immediately after <body>, insert EXACTLY this:

<script>
  fbq('track', 'Lead');
</script>

RULES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED:
 • Lead script MUST be inside <body>
 • Lead script MUST appear BEFORE any countdown or redirect script
 • Lead MUST NOT be wrapped in comments
 • Lead MUST NOT be placed inside <head>
 • Lead MUST NOT appear on the homepage

If you put Lead on the wrong page → Meta can’t verify it → Lead never turns green.

⸻

3️⃣ BUTTON LOGIC — DO NOT FIRE LEAD ON CLICK

The join button MUST NOT fire Lead.

The join button must redirect to the LIVE success page:

<a href="/success.html">Join VIP Group</a>

Then the success.html page fires Lead automatically.

This is why Meta turns Lead green — because Meta SEES a dedicated lead page.

⸻

4️⃣ REDIRECT PAGE — MUST HAVE COUNTDOWN BEFORE TELEGRAM

Inside success.html:

<p id="counter">5</p>

<script>
let i = 5;
let link = 'THE SAME TELEGRAM LINK ALREADY USED ON THE SITE';

const timer = setInterval(() => {
  i--;
  document.getElementById('counter').textContent = i;
  if (i <= 0) {
    clearInterval(timer);
    window.location.href = link;
  }
}, 1000);
</script>

DO NOT CHANGE THE TELEGRAM LINK

Use the same link that was already in the repo.
Do not replace it with anything else.

⸻

5️⃣ AFTER IMPLEMENTATION — CHECKLIST (DO NOT SKIP)

Before deploying, confirm:

✔ Pixel ID appears only once per page
✔ PageView fires on all pages
✔ Lead fires ONLY on the success page
✔ Lead script is right after <body>
✔ PageView script is inside <head>
✔ Join button goes to /success.html
✔ Countdown page works
✔ Redirect goes to Telegram
✔ No duplicated pixel IDs
✔ No console errors

ONLY when all items are correct, deploy.
