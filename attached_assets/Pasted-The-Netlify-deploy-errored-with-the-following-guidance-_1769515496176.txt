The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Isolation
- Relevant error: [line 5](#L5) — "git ref refs/heads/main does not exist or you do not have permission".
- The build fails when preparing the repository: [lines 4–6](#L4-L6).

Diagnosis
- Error type: Git branch or permissions error.
- Cause: Netlify attempted to check out refs/heads/main but that branch is not available to Netlify (either the repository’s default/target branch is named differently, e.g. master, or Netlify lacks permission to access the repo or that branch).

Solution
1. Verify the branch exists in the repo
   - Go to your GitHub repo and confirm which branch you want to deploy (e.g. main or master).
   - If your repo uses a different branch name (for example master), either:
     - Change Netlify to deploy that branch (see step 2), or
     - Create a main branch and push it:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b main
       git push -u origin main
       ```

2. Point Netlify to the correct branch
   - In the Netlify dashboard for your site: Site settings → Build & deploy → Continuous Deployment → Branch to deploy (or Deploy settings → Branch to deploy). Set it to the branch name that exists in your repo (e.g. master).
   - Or re-link the repository and pick the correct branch when configuring the site.

3. If the branch exists but Netlify still reports the error, re-authorize Netlify’s access (permissions)
   - In Netlify: Site settings → Build & deploy → Repository → Edit settings → Re-link repository (or unlink and link again).
   - On GitHub: check Applications → Authorized OAuth Apps → Netlify and ensure Netlify is permitted to access the repository/organization (especially for private repos or org repos). Grant access or reauthorize if needed.

4. After making the change, trigger a new deploy from Netlify.
